frontend dev test
===============

overview:
  
  create a backbone.js (using handlebars) to display the data found in metadata.json and things.json resembling the wireframe
  
approximate time:

  should take 1-3 hours depending on familiarity with backbone

instructions:

  1. fork this repo
  2. once cloned locally, you can develop however you feel most comfortable. we've included server.js which you can use with node
    so that you can have a local dev server running locally quickly. if you have your own setup you like to use, that's fine too.
  3. use index.html as your starting point, it has all necessary css and javascript libraries already defined in it. you should not
    need anything else. this is a backbone/handlebars/twitter bootstrap test.
  4. refer to the wireframe for layout and placement of content
  5. metadata.json has boilerplate page content, things.json has the meat of the page
  ???
  6. feel free to ask questions anytime. if something sounds weird or broken, ask! we're not trying to trick you, 
    maybe we just forgot something.
    

deliverables:

  1. completed index.html
  2. any extra css files
  3. any extra javascript files
