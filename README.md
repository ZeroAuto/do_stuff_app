===============

Overview:
-  
  Create a simple backbone.js app to display today's and tomorrow's top events on do512.com.
  
Approximate time:
-
  1-3 hours depending on familiarity with Backbone & Handlebars

Detailed instructions:
-
  1. Start by forking this repo and develop from within this repo
  2. Create a single page JS app using Backbone and Handlebars
  3. The app should have two routes: 1 displaying the first page of today's events and 1 displaying the first page of tomorrow's events
  4. You can fetch the data from http://do512.com/events/today.json and http://do512.com/events/tomorrow.json. Note: you'll need to use JSONP as the dataType to get around CORS issues.
  5. Display the data using the wireframe in this repo as a guide
